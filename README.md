NeHe_OpenGL_Qt4
===============

build NeHe OpenGL tutorials in Qt4

As Qt is cross-platform framework, so used freetype and ftgl in lesson13, lesson14, lesson15 to create font.

freetype-2.5.3:http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.5.3/

ftgl-2.1.3:http://sourceforge.net/projects/ftgl/files/FTGL%20Source/2.1.3~rc5/

Note: Lesson13,Lesson14,Lesson15,Lesson35,Lesson43 should copy resource file to their execution directory.

Missed Lesson47 CG Vertex Shader, I'm sorry that my computer is ATI card, and maybe it can't used in other platform except windows.
